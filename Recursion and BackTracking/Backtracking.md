Recursion : Any function which calls itself is called recursive.
    - It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates.

Why Recursion?
    - It is borrowed from mathematics
    - It is shorter and easier than iterative code


Recursion versue Iteration
    - It is depend on what we are trying to do

    - Versue
        - Recursion
            - Terminates when a base case is reached
            - Each recursive call requires extra space on the stack frame(memory)
            - If you make wrong code, the program may run out of memory and result in stack overflow
        - Iteration
            - Terminates when a condition is proven to be false.
            - Each iteration does not require extra space.
            - It may not always be as obvious as a recursive one.


Example : Towers of Hanoi puzzle

What is Backtracking?
    - It is an improvement of the brute force approach.
    - It can be thought of as a selective tree/graph traversal method.
    - What's interesting about it is that we back up  only as far as needed to reach a previous decision point with an as-yet-unexplored alternative.

Example of Backtracking
    - Binary Strings: generating all binary strings
    - Generating K-ary Strings
    - N-Queens Problem
    - The Knapsack Problem
    - Generalized Strings
    - Hamiltionian Cycles
    - Graph Coloring Problem.
