The heart of dynamic programming is to figure out the maximum.
Actually it is the best way to do operation research.
For instance, it include LIS, minimum edint distance.

The way to solve a problem in DP is Brute force search.
Figuring out the maximum is to explore all answers possible.

To avoid not nessaracy searching, we need memo and DP table.

How to make Equation of state in DP? 
    - What's base case in the problem?
    - What status does the problem have?
    - What choices can each state change?
    - How do you define "DP arrays and functions" to represent "state" and "choice"? 

Here's the thing.
    - Status, Choice, Define of DP array.

What is top-down?
    - Until reaching base case, we take it apart and return solution.
