Process of how to solve DP problem.
1. Find Status and choice
2. Define DP array / function
3. Figure out connection between statuses.

LIS = Baisc Algorithm of DP

- DP = mathematical induction

dp[0...i-1] is already calculated. How do we calculate dp[i]?

Define dp[i] : LIS of nums[i]

[DP?](https://museop.github.io/computer%20algorithm/2017/08/13/Dynamic-Programming.html)

The way to figure out relationship and transitions of parts
1. Clarify meaning of data in DP array.
2. If dp[0...i-1] is already calculated, think about how to get dp[i]
