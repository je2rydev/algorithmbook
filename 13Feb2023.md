Note for Computer science words in English

Variables : Something is holding data in computer.
Data Types : A set of data with predefined values.
    - System-defined data types (= Primitive data types)
        : They are defined by system : int, float, char, double, bool, etc.
    - User-defined data types
        : They are defined by coder : struct, class

Data Structure : Particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
    - Linear data structures : Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues (sequential order)
    - Non-linear data structures : Tree, graphs


ADT (Abstract Data Types) : Datastructure with their operations like addition, subtraction..
    - Two parts
        - Declaration of data
        - Declaration of operations
    - Include
        - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Binary Trees .. 

Algorithm : Step by Step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem.
    - Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorihm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.

Rates of growth
    - Order
        - 2^2^n -> n! -> 4^n -> 2^n -> n^2 -> nlogn -> log(n!) -> n -> 2^logn -> log2N -> root(logn) -> loglogn -> 1
        - Constant : 1
        - Logarithmic : logn
        - Linear : n
        - Quadratic : n^2
